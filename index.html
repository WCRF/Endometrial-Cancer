        <h2>About this repository</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the official <a href="https://github.com/WCRF/Endometrial-Cancer/tree/main" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> for the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) systematic review project on the <strong>association of circulating and tissue intermediate markers with Endometrial cancer</strong>. This repository is dedicated to hosting and showcasing interactive figures and visualizations derived from our analysis.</p>
        <p>We employed interactive data visualization tools, primarily utilizing <a href="https://plotly.com/" target="_blank">Plotly<a/>. We used Treemaps, Sunburst plots, and other hierarchical plotting methods to interactively present the heterogeneous data we observed in Endometrial Cancer studies. These plots simplify the depth of heterogeneity across studies and synthesize the results of the individual studies. The purpose was to present the direction of association between biomarkers and endometrial cancer or display differential polymorphisms, mRNA, and protein expression levels of Endometrial Cancer compared to tissue obtained from women with normal endometrium or hyperplasia.</p>

        <h2>Project overview</h2>
        <p>This project aims to explore and elucidate the complex relationships between various intermediate risk factors and the risk of developing Endometrial Cancer. The intermediate risk factors included several biomarkers broadly categorized in three pathways: Sex steroids, Inflammation, and Insulin and Insulin-like Growth factors.  Our systematic review encompasses a wide range of data on the three pathways. We analyzed data extracted from individual studies and presented a comprehensive view of the existing evidence.</p>
        <h2>Key focus areas</h2>
        <p><strong>Circulating Markers:</strong> In this section, we investigated pre-diagnostic circulating biomarkers and their association with the risk of Endometrial Cancer. We presented the heterogeneous data using hierarchical plots implemented in the <a href="https://plotly.com/" target="_blank">Plotly library in Python</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Tissue Expression Profiles:</strong> Detailed analysis of gene and protein expression profiles in tissue samples and their significant difference or association with the risk of endometrial cancer. We mapped the difference in tissue expression profiles regarding Endometrial cancer and normal endometrium, tumor-adjacent tissues, or several types of hyperplastic endometrium such as simple hyperplasia without atypia, simple hyperplasia with atypia, complex hyperplasia with or without atypia.</p>
