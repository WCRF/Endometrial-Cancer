<p> About This Repository</p>
<p>Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) systematic review project titled on the **the association of circulating and tissue intermediate markers with Endometrial cancer**. This repository is dedicated to hosting and showcasing interactive figures and visualizations derived from our extensive research and analysis.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p> Project Overview</p>
<p>This project aims to explore and elucidate the complex relationships between various intermediate exposures and the risk of developing Endometrial Cancer. Our systematic review encompasses a wide range of data, thoroughly analyzed to present a comprehensive view of the current understanding in this field.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p> Key Focus Areas</p>
<p>Circulating Markers: Investigation into biomarkers present in plasma/serum and their correlation with the risk of Endometrial Cancer.</p>
<p>Tissue Expression Profiles: Detailed analysis of gene and protein expression profiles in tissue samples and their significant difference or association with the risk of endometrial cancer. We mapped the diffference in tissue expression profiles regarding between Endometrial cancer and normal endometrium, tumor adjacent tissues, or several types of hyperplastic endometrium such as simple hyperplasia without atypia, simple hyperplasia with atypia, complex hyperplasia with or without atypia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have employed state-of-the-art interactive data visualization tools, primarily utilizing Plotly. We used Treempas, Sunburts plots and other heirarchial plotting methods to interactively present the hetrogeneous data we observed in Enodmetrial Cancer. These visualizations aim to provide a clearer understanding of the data and insights gathered during our research.</p>
